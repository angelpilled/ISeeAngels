One post is approximately 1270 pixels, so:

1. profile pic column is: 50 pixels, that is: 4%
2. post title, etc is 850 pixels, that is: 66%
3. replies, views is 135 pixels, that is 10%
4. date is 190 pixels, that is 15%
5. last commenter is 40 pixels, that is 5%

These numbers are not accurate, just an approximation.
